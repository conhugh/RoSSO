By default, when you run strat_opt or strat_viz, results and visualizations will
be saved to the "results/local" folder, which has been added to the .gitignore
included with this repo. So, the results which are contained in "results/local" 
will NOT be included in updates pushed to the remote repo. This is by design, to 
keep things clean and prevent the remote repo from becoming too large. 

If you want a specific set of results to be pushed to the remote repo, copy the
directory containing the results of interest to this "results/shared" folder, 
then push your updates.
